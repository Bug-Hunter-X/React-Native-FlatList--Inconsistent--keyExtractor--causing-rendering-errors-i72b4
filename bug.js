This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an incorrect or inconsistent `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for efficiently updating the list when data changes.  If the function doesn't return a unique key for each item, React Native may not be able to properly track and update the list items, leading to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering or crashes.  This often results in errors similar to `Invariant Violation: Invariant Violation: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {...})` or other related rendering errors.
